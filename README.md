# What the Tide Keeps

A 2D open-world web RPG with turn-based combat, set in a medieval world of animals. A hero framed for regicide is sentenced to fight, die, and be resurrected. Every death takes a memory.

The first version is a solo game that runs entirely in the browser.

## Design

The [design guideline](docs/design-guideline.md) contains the story, world, combat and memory systems, regional progression, technology choices, and playable build order.

## Technical direction

- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Rendering:** Phaser
- **Maps:** Tiled
- **Saves:** Browser local storage
- **Game rules:** Plain TypeScript, independent of Phaser, so combat and memory systems can be tested without a browser and moved to a server for future co-op.

## Starting point

Build the repeatable loop in miniature before adding the full story. The first playable milestone is a small Tiled map with a moving character, starting with the hero waking in the church. Add the feast opening after the loop works.

This repository currently contains design documentation only; the game has not been implemented.

## Open question

- What are each companion's memories?
